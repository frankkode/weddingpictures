## Wedding pictures

The project idea is that guests can send pictures taken during a newlywed couple's wedding ceremony. This application is offline first, has installable icons, can work offline, and more...

install and run this project:
### FIrebase setting
Go to firebase and create a storage and database (use firestorage)
set a project as test, get credential and add them in config.js

### `npm insatall`
run commend in your terminal npm install to install node packages

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `serve -s build``

run the project in local by running serve -s build
note:if you don't have serve installed on your machine, do it first by running this commend npm i serve to be able to sarve static files.
